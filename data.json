    "Hi there! I'm <strong><em>Xinyue</em></strong>, a climate policy researcher by day, diver and traveler by heart, and proud cat mom to <strong><em>Doctor Liuliu</em></strong>.",
    "I spend most of my time exploring how countries like China can build a cleaner, fairer energy future, and how data, policy, and imagination can actually work together. When I'm not deep in spreadsheets or writing reports, you'll probably find me chasing sunshine, wandering new cities, or floating somewhere under the sea.",
    "I believe in curiosity, kindness, and doing meaningful work, and in always saving time for good boba, good buddies, and the next adventure."
